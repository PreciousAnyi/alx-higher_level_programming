# Python Almost a Circle Project

This project implements functionalities for creating and manipulating shapes, focusing on rectangles and squares. The project includes classes and methods for managing these shapes, as well as unit tests to ensure their correctness.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains Python modules defining classes for rectangles and squares.
- `tests/`: Includes unit test files to test the functionalities of the classes and methods.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to run tests and ensure PEP 8 compliance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-higher_level_programming.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-higher_level_programming/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3.8.5 installed on your system.

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pycodestyle
   ```

## Running Tests
To run the unit tests for the project, execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest discover tests
   ```
This command will automatically discover and run all unit tests in the tests/ directory.

## Ensuring PEP 8 Compliance
To ensure that all Python files in the project adhere to the PEP 8 style guide, use the pycodestyle tool. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   pycodestyle models/ tests/
   ```
This command will check all Python files in the models/ and tests/ directories for PEP 8 compliance.
